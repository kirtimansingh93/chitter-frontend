# Chitter API Frontend Challenge

Challenge:
----------
A Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream. Someone has already built a backend API and hosted it on Heroku.

The task is to build a front-end single-page-app to interface with this API.[The API documentation is here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend)

Here are some interactions the API supports:

* Creating Users
* Logging in
* Posting Peeps
* Viewing all Peeps *(I suggest you start here)*
* Viewing individual Peeps
* Deleting Peeps
* Liking Peeps
* Unliking Peeps
